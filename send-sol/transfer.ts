 * Commitment levels determine how finalized the data you‚Äôre querying needs to be. Here are the main commitment levels:

	‚Ä¢	‚Äúprocessed‚Äù: The node has processed the transaction but hasn‚Äôt confirmed it with the cluster yet.
	‚Ä¢	‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù: The transaction has been confirmed by the cluster but might not be fully finalized.
	‚Ä¢	‚Äúfinalized‚Äù: The transaction is fully finalized and part of the immutable ledger.

So, "confirmed" means you‚Äôre establishing a connection that prioritizes querying data or transactions 
that have been confirmed by the cluster but aren‚Äôt necessarily fully finalized. 
This level strikes a balance between data freshness and reliability.
